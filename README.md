### Hello! I am Adriana
My research focuses on the role of microorganisms in sustainable agriculture, with a particular emphasis on soil-plant-microbe interactions. I am interested in how agricultural systems, climate change, and plant management practices influence microbial communities in bulk soil, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane, and their overall impact on plant health.
